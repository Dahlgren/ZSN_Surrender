description = "This mod adds a surrender mechanic for the AI. If a unit is fleeing and the closest enemy (that he knows of) is closer than his closest friend, the unit will surrender. A wounded enemy will also surrender if he is surrounded by enemy. I also included a mechanic for making AI disembark from vehicles if they have enemy within 50 meters.";
